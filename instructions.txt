Instructions to run the code on local system

1. The dependecies of the file are provided in requirements.txt
    !pip install requirements.txt

2. Download the dataset from the Google drive link provided and change the value of variable ''data_drive_location'' 
in cell 4 to your current location, for example "/home/usr/downloads/Data"

3. On proceeding to run the code with run all in Google colab or Jupyter Notebook you should be able to see 4 new files 
generated which would contain predictions for each subtask and each phase.

4. You should also be able to see various outputs which would be something like 
    [predictions]
    MAE: some value   Pearsonr: (some value, some value)
    
   These will be in the order Subtask-1: Train, Trial, Test
                  Followed by Subtask-2: Train, Trial, Test respectively
                
It would be easier to run the code on the Google Colab link provided.
Running the code from another user can be done by Adding a shortcut of the Google Drive provided to your Google Drive, mounting the Google Drive onto the Colab Notebook and changing the value of the variable ''data_drive_location'' accordingly.
Run all and the code should run smoothly.
The credentials for the Google Account in use has been provided in credentials.txt, in case there are issues running the code from another account.
